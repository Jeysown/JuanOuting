              Juanderpool Inc is founded on May 2016 by Glenwin
              Bernabe, Jason Lopez, and Joyce Potestades who’s
              graduating student of Information Technology at
              Technological Institute of the Philippines - Manila. Jason is
              having a hard time in booking a private pool that will suit
              their family’s budget and needs. The only means of
              communicating with private pool is through social media
              platforms and listing sites where you need to contact them
              individually which is not a secure way to transact your
              booking. You need to trust a stranger and pay them the
              specific amount so they’ll be able to reserve the private pool
              in the given schedule.
            </p>

              Because of these problems, he pitched his ideas to his
              classmates and they decided to create an application that will
              be the solution to eliminate the old ways of booking a private
              pool here in the Philippines.
            </p>
            <p>
              On October 2016, the founders joined Eureka!thon Y which is
              the corporate incubation program of the PJ Lhullier Group of
              Companies as spearheaded by its ICT Arm, Networld Capital
              Ventures, Inc. They won the contest and were given the
              opportunity to have the full support in establishing their own
              start up business.

              They believe that vacation experience doesn’t begin in the
              swimming pool but the experience should rather start in
              choosing a private pool and ends with giving their feedback
              about their amazing experience.
